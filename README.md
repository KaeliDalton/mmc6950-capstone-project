# MyReads
Welcome to MyReads, an application designed to allow readers to find new books, and keep notes about their reading habits and opinions! I built this application using JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I created this application as a capstone project for my Master of Arts in Mass Communication program with a concentration in Web Design and Online Communications.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features
User Authentication using MongoDB as a database solution

Search for books using data from the Google Books API
