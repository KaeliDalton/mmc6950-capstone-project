# MyReads
Welcome to MyReads, an application designed to allow readers to find new books, and keep notes about their reading habits and opinions! I built this application using JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I created this application as a capstone project for my Master of Arts in Mass Communication program with a concentration in Web Design and Online Communications.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features
User Authentication using MongoDB as a database solution

Search for books using data from the Google Books API

Add books to a user list

View detailed book information

Create notes about previously read or currently being read books 

View your past book notes

## Usage

## Getting Started
To use MyReads, first sign up for an account, and then log in. Once logged in, you can either search for a book to get more information or add it to your list, or you can create a book note. Your notes and book lists are saved to your account and always available to access later. Happy reading!
